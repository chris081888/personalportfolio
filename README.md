ChatGPT was used in fixing this site. This was mainly to fix appropriate containers for data as my project box was not working.
Everything else was written by me, with some adjustments based on stackoverflow suggestions on replacing the LinkedIN and GitHub logos for the links.

Any code that was copied/pasted had to be heavily refactored.

Luckily I churn out data websites at work all day :)
